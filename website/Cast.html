        <!-- NOTE: I created a div class "header" so that I can customise the styling of this section on css therefore keeping my html sheets tidy.

<img height=190px; src="IMAGE\gog logo reworked.png" alt="GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY">
</h1>
        <!-- NOTE: Using H1 either side of the img will allow me to apply the css styling of H1 to the alt text of the image. This will allow the site
                  to be aethtetic in situations that the header logo can't be loaded. -->

<div class="Menu">
        <!-- NOTE: I created a div class "menu" to be able to edit the styling of the menu section on my css page. An advantage of doing most of my
                  styling in css is that it will increase the speed of wich the webpage loads. -->
<nav>
        <!-- NOTE: The nav tag defines the start of a navigational section on the website. -->
<a href="Synopsis.html">SYNOPSIS</a>
        <!-- NOTE: The A tag is for adding a link to your nav section. The href attribute tells the webpage where the link is linking to. -->
&nbsp&nbsp
        <!-- NOTE: Originaly the menu options were too close togethr and it felt cramped. I solved this by using "&nbsp" which adds a spacing between elements. -->

        <!-- NOTE: I ended the both the header and the menu div here as I wanted the header class effects to be applied to the menu aswell -->

<div class="textbox">
        <!-- NOTE: By creating the "textbox" class I'm able to box around the different sections of the site in a consistent manner. This also makes the
                  website easier to navigate as youre able to see where the different sections start and end. -->
<h2>MEET THE CAST</h2>
        <!-- NOTE: I use h2 for section titles across the site to ensure consistency. I  also capitalise all my title as the lettering in the logo is all
                  Uppercase so it keeps the guardians of the galaxy theme throughout. I could develop this by downloading the font and producing the headings
                  in photoshop and export them out as pngs. The disadvantage of doing this is the more images I use, the slowwer the website will load. Futhermore,
                  png's might not be compatible on all websites and .jpgs ect don't allow transparent backgrounds hence making the website look les aethtetic. -->
</div>


<div class="container">
<div class="textbox">
        <!-- NOTE: I wanted each castmember to have thir own box to be placed in on the cast page so im putting each cast member in their own Div class
                  "textbox" this is a stylistic choice but also keeps in theme with the project breif templates.-->


  <img style="padding: 20px"; height=300px; src="IMAGE\chris pratt.jpg"; alt="Image of Chris Pratt"; align="left";>
        <!-- NOTE: Originally when I added the image it filled up the page so I set the height to 300px. I used px instead of % to ensure consistency across
                  the site as different images of different actors may have different resolutions resulting in images being different sises. Once I resized the
                  image I found that I was only able to add text under it. To solve this I added the "alaign=left" attribute. I then felt that the text was too
                  close to the image so I added the style="padding 20px" attribute. -->
        <!-- NOTE: I realise now that when the browser gets resized for mobile ect the text will either wrapdown and past the image or it will not reach the base
                  of the image for wider windows. This means that the image may on occasion overhang the text box background.-->
        <!-- NOTE: To fix the image overhanging issue I have used a combination of css stying to the image and I used the div class="container"-->


<h3>Chris Pratt</h3>
        <!-- NOTE: For the cast member names I chose to use the H3 styling to ensure consistency on the site. Additionally if I nedd to make adaptations to the
                  style of the actors names I can write less code by changinging the H3 atributes in the css style sheet. -->

        <!-- NOTE: For the cast I wanted to provide some basic information such as year of birth, where they're from and what they've also featured in. Initially
                  I separated the different facts by putting Breaks <br> before and in between each line. It is much bettter practice to break up text by putting
                  them In different paragraphs. Therefore, I recified this by putting each fact in separate paragraphs. This acheived the same effect, but with
                  less lines of code, on this occcasion the speed of which the web page loads wouldn't be affected. however, for larger web pages it I is smart
                  to use every method to keep the lines of code to a minimum. One occasion where breaks <br> are indeed useful is when writing adresses without
                  line breaks.-->
<audio controls>
        <!-- NOTE: Using the <audio> tag defines the start of some code relating to audio. I then used the controls attribute to give the user control over the

        <!-- NOTE: To fit the breif I needed to add audio clips for each castmember I downladed a video from youtube, I trimed it down to two minutes and exported
                  the audio. I trimmed it down to two minutes to save space on filesizes when uploading the website to github. normally a client would expect
                  the full video clip to be available on their website.-->
  <source src="AUDIO\chris_pratt_interview.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        <!-- NOTE: I exported the video to different recognised audio formats to maximise compatability across a variety of browsers. This is because some
                  outdated browsers may not recognise different audio formats.-->
  <source src="AUDIO\chris_pratt_interview.wav" type="audio/wav">
        <!-- NOTE: using the source tag defines where to look for the audio. Because the file is located within the website folders I used the project path to
                  locate what audio clip to use. By using the type attribute, the browser knows what the audio format is and wether it's able to play it.-->
    Your browser does not support this audio clip.

                differently to other bodies of text. This is why I made the class "smalltext". This way I can edit the styling in css and reduce my lines of
                code in my html pages when applying this styling on severaloccasions across different pages of my website.-->

        <!-- NOTE: The <A> attribute tells the code that it's a link. Href attribute defines what link or path that youre linking to. Originaly when the link
                gets clicked the website opens in the current tab. Because it's an external page I wanted the viewwer to open the page in in a new tab, making
                it easier to get back to the website, increasing audience retention. Therefore I set the target to "_blank" to open the tab in a new page.
                by using the rel attribute, I set my relationship to the url as "noopener noreferrer" which prevents potential melicious attacks from the
                websites I'm linking to. -->

        <!-- NOTE: The original images I found of the actors on the internet were different sizes & different aspect ratios. If I just inserted the images
                  as they were, the images would be different shapes and sizes which would look very un professional. To fix this I inserted the Images
                  into an image manipulation programme called photoshop and exported them to be 1565px x 2293px therefore making the images identicle size
                  and aspect ratio.-->

<h3>Zoe Saldana</h3>
        <!-- NOTE: Again to remain consstent with the rest of the website, I used the h3 styling for cast member names. Doing this also helps to to emphasise
